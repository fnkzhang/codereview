cacheUtils.getCloudStorageCache()

cacheUtils.initSharedCache(topic_id: str, cacheConfig: dict)

   **Explanation:**
      Publisher sends the key to the Topic to indicate that the
      resource was updated. Any Subscribers that are subscribed to the
      Topic will receive the key.

   **Args:**
      -topic_id: Topic ID Column in
      https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic. Make sure
      there is a Subscription with the same name suffixed with a
      "-sub" in
      https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription. -key:
      Unique identifier of the updated resource. Must be the same as
      the key used to cache the resource.

   **Returns:**
      -cache (bytes): Contents in the cache as bytes

cacheUtils.publishTopicUpdate(topic_id: str, key: str)

   **Explanation:**
      Publisher sends the key to the Topic to indicate that the
      resource was updated. Any Subscribers that are subscribed to the
      Topic will receive the key.

   **Args:**
      -topic_id: Topic ID Column in
      https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic. Make sure
      there is a Subscription with the same name suffixed with a
      "-sub" in
      https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription. -key:
      Unique identifier of the updated resource. Must be the same as
      the key used to cache the resource.

cacheUtils.subscribeToTopicUpdate(topic_id: str, cacheToUpdate: Cache)

   **Explanation:**
      Subscriber receives the key as a message by the Topic's
      Publisher and deletes the key from cache. Caching prevents
      repetitive requests to Google Buckets and Cloud SQL when a
      resource has not been updated. Deleting the key from cache will
      force a request for the updated resource.

   **Args:**
      -topic_id: Topic ID Column in
      https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic. Make sure
      there is a Subscription with the same name suffixed with a
      "-sub" in
      https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription.
      -cacheToUpdate: The cache from which the key will be removed.
